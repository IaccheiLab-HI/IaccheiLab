Her research interests include coral adaptation to increasing ocean temperatures and changing water chemistry, and how knowledge of coral resilience can be applied to future restoration efforts. During her studies, she volunteered at the DAR Hawai‘i Coral Restoration Nursery and assisted with the Ciguatera poisoning project in the Iacchei Lab.
