    "text": "Larval Dispersal and Recruitment\n\n\nOver 85% of marine species have a bi-phasic lifestyle with an adult phase which is relatively sedentary compared to the larval or juvenile phase, which move far offshore and disperse thousands of kilometers to find new settlement habitat or to escape nearshore predators during this vulnerable life stage. Understanding the dynamics of this larval phase can determine seasonality of reproduction and recruitment, the connection between different locations or identify barriers between populations and inform which areas constitute sources of juveniles – areas of high reproductive output, and which areas are sink populations – locations where many juveniles arrive and recruit. Examples of previous and ongoing projects include: using a DNA barcode to identify larval fishes in Kāneʻohe Bay across a two different years to investigate how larval fish recruitment varied in different regions of the bay and search for recruits of culturally important food fishes; using DNA barcoding to identify the species crab megalops – the final larval stage prior to settlement in their adult habitat to species - to investigate lunar, seasonal and regional patterns in recruitment of different crab species along the Kona Coast of Hawaiʻi Island while searching for elusive larval recruits of the Kona crab; DNA barcoding for species identification and morphological aging of lobster phyllosoma larval stages to understand where the six species of spiny and slipper lobster travel across the Hawaiian Archipelago over their 6 to 12 month larval dispersal time period to identify sources and sink populations of these important recreational and subsistence fishery species.\n\n\n\nModels of trophic dynamics are crucial to predicting impacts of fishing, environmental change, introduced species, and other anthropogenic impacts to ecosystems. Predator diets provide key insights into trophic interactions, but the prey of many marine species is not readily identifiable morphologically especially for prey that do not contain any hard parts that persist in the guts for a long time. By barcoding and metabarcoding the gut content of a variety of marine species we can reveal a broader scope of their diet, and in turn the relative importance and connection among species throughout the tropic web. Examples of previous and ongoing projects include DNA barcoding and metabarcoading of opah (moon fish) diets across the range of the Hawaiian tuna fishing fleet to understand niche partitioning across the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones in big-eye versus small-eye opah; investigating diets of aku (skipjack tuna) across the adult size range to assess whether there are ontogenetic (size or age-based) shifts in diet or if there are spatial differences in feeding preference; metabarcoding of seabird guano and barfs (metabarfcoding) to understand foraging behavior and diet of multiple seabird species in Hawaiʻi; DNA metabarcoding of gut contents of multiple flying fish species in Hawaiʻi and the North Pacific to understand the targeted prey of these key intermediaries connecting secondary consumers and top predators\nUnderstanding trophic interactions through the lens of predator diets\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring ecological communities across space and time, to understand how they are responding to environmental change and other anthropogenic impacts\n\nAll environmental survey techniques have advantages and disadvantages in terms of the types of organisms they detect and can effectively monitor. Using environmental DNA (eDNA) allows us to track many taxa that are not traditionally observed with classical in-field survey approaches. By using different gene regions we can target different organisms and tailor ecological surveys to specific questions and species. Example projects include working with school kids on Hawaiʻi Island to survey fish species by taking water samples from the shallows along their coastline;\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

During her time as an undergraduate at HPU, she was a voluntary laboratory assistant on the Seabird Tissue Archival and Monitoring Project (STAMP), a collaboration between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and HPU to investigate environmental contaminants in seabird eggs. In addition to that, she participated in the Our Project in Hawaii’s Intertidal (OPIHI) internship through the University of Hawai‘i, Manoa Campus. During this internship, she used stable isotopes as a tool to examine mullet food web dynamics in Heʻeia Fishpond. \nBuilding upon her work done during the OPIHI internship, she decided to continue her education with HPU’s Master of Science Marine Science Program (MSMS). Her research focused on assessing mullet recruitment on a spatiotemporal scale within Kāne’ohe Bay. Savannah has a passion for conducting science with a purpose that will push the boundaries of scientific knowledge, while also producing results that are directly tangible to local Hawaiian communities and the public. \n\n\n Back to top"
