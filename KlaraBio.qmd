# Bio

Klara graduated from Hawai‘i Pacific University with an M.Sc. in Marine Science in 2025, where she studied the relationship between Pocillopora meandrina (cauliflower coral) and cryptofauna—tiny fish and invertebrates that live between the coral’s branches around Hawai‘i. Her research interests include coral adaptation to increasing ocean temperatures and changing water chemistry, and how knowledge of coral resilience can be applied to future restoration efforts. During her studies, she volunteered at the DAR Hawai‘i Coral Restoration Nursery and assisted with the Ciguatera poisoning project in the Iacchei Lab. She is now pursuing a Ph.D. in Evolution and Marine Biology at the University of Rhode Island under the supervision of Dr. Hollie Putnam, focusing on genetic traits in corals that affect their survival in the changing environment.
